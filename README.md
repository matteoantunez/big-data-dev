## Background

Here, I was able to take both dual credit and online courses through Peru State College and Southeast Community College respectively. These courses earned myself 35 college credits which all transfered and applied successfully to my degree program.

Beyond academics, I have always had a nitch within competing. Before college, I had competed in numerous local compeitions in Future Business Leaderes of America (FBLA), Microsoft Office Specalist (MOS), Cheer, and Band. I was able to attend national competitions for FBLA and MOS and placed second at FBLA nationals in Microsoft Office Speaclist - Excel. 

In college, I worked with the Bearcat Winterguard and Bearcat Marching Band my freshmen year, with the Bearcat Winterguard placing 3rd at state. Currently, I am focusing on Virtual Reality (VR) gaming and competitions. I have not competed in any touraments, but am training to compete in Beat Saber.
